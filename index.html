               <h1>Project of Console </h1>
               <p> Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development
                environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop 
                computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web 
                services and mobile apps. ... Visual Studio includes a
                 code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion
                  component) as well as code refactoring.</p>

                  <p> A console is the combination of a monitor and 
                  keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which
                   the monitor provides the output and the keyboard 
                   is used for input. While any computer with a 
                   monitor and keyboard may be considered a console,
                    the term most often refers to a system used to 
                    control one or more servers.</p>
